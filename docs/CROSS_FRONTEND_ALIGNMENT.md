## Important mismatches to resolve before the backend phase

- Product identifiers differ: Admin headphone is `p-101`; Storefront headphone is `p-headphones`. Other product IDs also differ.
- Category IDs differ: Admin uses e.g. `cat-electronics`; Storefront uses `electronics`. Category offerings are not identical, and Admin supports nested categories.
- Product records differ: Storefront products have `slug`, `title`, image gallery (`src`/`alt`), and option-based variants; Admin products have `name`, `categoryId`, `images` with `url`/`alt`, and `size`/`color`/`sku` variants. They need a shared canonical DTO schema and stable identifiers.
- Variant options differ: Storefront may have many size/color combinations; Admin sample inventory for sneakers covers only a subset. Current previews cannot be considered synchronized stock.
- Storefront checkout does not consume Admin shipping/tax policy. It uses static sample rates; a future server-side pricing/eligibility API must unify these.
- Admin reporting has fictional sample payment statuses; Storefront has no completed real orders or payments. Do not infer actual checkout metrics from Admin sample rows.
- Admin coupons and banners are not published to Storefront and cannot be validated end to end before the shared backend exists.

## Recommended follow-up

Before building shared backend APIs, write a single versioned OpenAPI contract for catalog IDs/slugs, category hierarchy, variants, images, address schema, country eligibility, price/tax/shipping quote, orders, payment state and refunds. Preserve both frontend UX flows and convert their local fixtures deliberately; do **not** silently assume Admin sample IDs match Storefront IDs.
